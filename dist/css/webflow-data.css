 * @use: This is the modern replacement for @import. 
 * Instead of dumping all the imported styles into the global scope, @use treats each imported file as a 
 * separate module with its own private scope. This means that variables, mixins, and functions from 
 * the imported file have to be accessed with a namespace based on the filename. 
 * This helps to prevent naming conflicts and makes the code easier to understand.
